- **Instant Feedback**: Correct/incorrect indicators with explanations
- **Score Report**: Percentage-based results with pass/fail notification
- **Curriculum-Aligned**: Questions cover core CBC science topics

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2. Save the code as `cbc_science_quiz.py`
3. Run in terminal:
```bash
python cbc_science_quiz.py
```

## Quiz Structure
- **Total Questions**: 15 per quiz
- **Question Types**: Multiple choice (options a-d)

  - Pass mark: 50% (‚â• 8 correct answers)
  - Immediate feedback after each response

## Question Bank Coverage
| Grade | Topics Covered |
|-------|----------------|
| 6     | Space, human anatomy, plant biology, states of matter, energy |
| 7     | Cell functions, nutrition, physics principles, ecosystems |
| 8     | Energy types, chemical reactions, ecosystems, electrical systems |

## Sample Questions
- *Grade 6*: "Which organ pumps blood in the human body?" 
- *Grade 7*: "What do green plants produce during photosynthesis?"
- *Grade 8*: "What type of energy is stored in food?"

## Output Example
```

  d) Plasma
Your answer (a/b/c/d): c
‚úÖ Correct!
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries only (no external dependencies)

## Learning Objectives
1. Reinforce CBC science concepts
2. Practice time management skills
3. Provide immediate knowledge feedback
4. Encourage self-assessment
